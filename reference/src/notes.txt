Section 15 Forms - Note

Angular job is to retrieve the value from the form and validate it. 
Need javascript object representation to represent value of the form.

{
    value: {
        name: 'Me',
        email: 'me@gmail.com'
    },
    valid: true 
}

Template Driven (TD) vs Reactive Approach
TD : Angular infers the Form object from the DOM 
Reactive : Form is created programmatically and sync with the DOM (more complex)

Form gak ada action dan method. Angular should handle this.
